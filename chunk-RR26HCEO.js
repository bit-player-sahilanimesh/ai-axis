    <p>Ten months ago, I opened ChatGPT for something very specific and very small: I wanted help understanding why I kept getting physics questions wrong for my FRCR Part 1 Physics. Not to cheat, not to shortcut\u2014just to see where my thinking was off. I pasted in a few practice questions, asked it to walk me through the wrong answers step-by-step, and within minutes I had clearer explanations than I'd given myself in hours of revision. That small win planted a seed: maybe this wasn't a gimmick; maybe it was a tutor with infinite patience.</p>

    <p>Not too long after passing the exam, life was getting full. I was preparing for on-calls, tracking endless to-dos, dealing with a summer calendar full of friends' weddings, and staring down a wall of textbooks that all felt important and somehow equally unapproachable. I wasn't short on motivation\u2014I was short on structure and time. The work was doable; the orchestration wasn't.</p>

    <h4>The Breakthrough: ChatGPT Projects</h4>
    <p>A friend then mentioned "ChatGPT Projects." He'd uploaded PDF copies of his key notes and textbooks, and was using targeted prompts: "Explain this CT finding with reference to [textbook], give me the page, then cross-check with Radiopaedia." It sounded a bit like magic. I tried it. It wasn't magic\u2014it was better. It was repeatable.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, my study sessions shifted. Instead of flipping between chapters, bookmarks, and browser tabs, I could ask for a focused explanation and get cited, cross-referenced guidance I could verify. I wasn't replacing the textbooks; I was triaging them. The time saved didn't just feel efficient; it felt humane. Space returned\u2014for proper thinking, for rest, for the other parts of life that do not fit neatly into a rota.</p>

    <p>That led to a quiet, ongoing experiment: if AI can help with this, what else can it help with\u2014without lowering the bar on accuracy or clinical judgement? I started building small, then iterating:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Summarising journal articles to decide whether they deserved a full read</li>
      <li>Turning messy bullet points into teaching slides, faster</li>
      <li>Logging learning points and action items from meetings in a way I'd actually revisit</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each improvement on its own was modest. Together, they changed the feel of work. Less scrambling, more clarity. Less context switching, more continuity.</p>

    <h4>The Tension and the Truth</h4>
    <p>Of course, there was a wobble. Like many clinicians first encountering this kind of technology, I worried about job security and professional identity. If AI can draft, summarise, and pattern-match, where do we fit? That anxiety is understandable\u2014and healthy. But it misses the practical truth I've seen again and again:</p>

    <p><strong>AI + professional beats AI alone or professional alone.</strong> The model is fast; the clinician is wise. The model is broad; the clinician is accountable. The model spots a pattern; the clinician knows which pattern matters here, now, for this person. Augmentation isn't a slogan\u2014it's the only arrangement that makes sense for safe, humane care.</p>

    <h4>Why Augmentible Exists</h4>
    <p>This is the mindset behind Augmentible. It wasn't born from techno-optimism; it came from feeling stretched and deciding to experiment my way out of it. We're building a place where healthcare professionals can learn the applied stuff: the prompts, the workflows, the governance guardrails, and the very human habits that let you use these tools without losing your judgement (or your weekend!)</p>

    <p>Right now, we're exploring a set of everyday helpers that smooth out the friction in clinical and academic life:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI meeting notes</strong> that capture decisions, owners, and deadlines you'll actually follow</li>
      <li><strong>AI-assisted calendar planning</strong> that translates goals into realistic time blocks (and respects clinics and on-calls)</li>
      <li><strong>Lightweight automations for admin</strong> you'd prefer not to spend brainpower on\u2014think templated emails, reading queues, audit logs, and tidy archives that don't become digital attics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We'll share the playbooks openly\u2014what works, what doesn't, and why. Expect step-by-step guides, short videos, and templates you can copy, plus honest notes about failure modes (because every "automation" breaks somewhere, and it helps to know where).</p>

    <h4>How to Get Started</h4>
    <p>If you're new to this, here's the simplest way to begin:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Pick one friction point (e.g., preparing for an exam, summarising a paper, or structuring teaching)</li>
      <li>Write down your current steps, then ask an AI tool to draft the same output from your inputs</li>
      <li>Keep your judgement in the loop. Compare, edit, and decide. Save the working prompt as a mini-template</li>
      <li>Repeat next week for a second task. Tiny, boring wins compound</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Augmentible is my attempt to bottle those tiny wins and hand them to colleagues who are as busy\u2014and as ambitious\u2014as I was when this started. Not to replace hard work, but to aim it better.</p>
