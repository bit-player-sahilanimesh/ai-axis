  <p><strong>From ChatGPT to Clinical Efficiency: The Story Behind Augmentible</strong></p>

  <p>My first encounter with ChatGPT was for a very small task; every one of my ST1 radiology colleagues had been talking about asking ChatGPT to help with physics preparation for our FRCR Part 1 physics exam. I began using ChatGPT only to help me understand why my \u2018true\u2019 or \u2018false\u2019 was the wrong answer.</p>

  <p>I was never too good at physics, but I guess I hadn\u2019t helped myself by leaving the tougher parts to 6 weeks before the exam. Surprisingly, when I asked ChatGPT to explain my wrong answers, I was stunned. It explained some things more clearly than Google, YouTube, and even some of my seniors! I passed the exam and didn\u2019t really think about it beyond that.</p>

  </p>
  <p><i>Figure 1 \u2013 ChatGPT Conversation Screenshot. A screenshot from a ChatGPT conversation I had in January 2025 where I wondered (briefly) if I should just give up Radiology. I chuckled to myself when I read that last line.</i></p>
  

  <p>Let\u2019s fast forward a few months. I had started preparing for on-calls. I was BUSY. Preparing for on-calls, getting ready for ARCP, juggling a packed social calendar and constantly feeling behind.</p>
  

  <p>That\u2019s when one of my seniors mentioned \u2018ChatGPT Projects\u2019. He\u2019d uploaded his textbooks and asked ChatGPT to use only those and Radiopaedia as references. Suddenly, everything changed. I was now reading 3 textbooks simultaneously, getting focused explanations (with page numbers) without having to open a single one. I saved HOURS. I learned more in the same time. I reclaimed so much of my time back.</p>
  

  <p>This moment changed my realisations around how we should be learning, but also how new technologies could make life easier.</p>
  

  <p>Since then, I\u2019ve used AI in all sorts of ways to save myself time:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Summarised my curriculum requirements into a manageable monthly checklist so I\u2019m not scrambling a month before the ARCP deadline</li>
    <li>Built teaching presentations in a mere fraction of the time (I once made slides in 10 minutes when I realised at 12:30 PM I was presenting at 1 PM!)</li>
    <li>Finding tradesmen with good reviews who can fix my issue (plumbers, electricians) in minutes instead of hours</li>
  </ul>
  

  <p>Are you noticing a theme? Each improvement was small, but they compounded and saved me a TONNE of time. In the last 12 months, I passed FRCR Part 1, started on-calls, completed a Postgraduate Award in AI in Healthcare, and submitted 3 papers. The previous year? I was just trying to stay afloat. So what changed?</p>
  

  <p><strong>The Power of Leverage</strong></p>
  

  <p>The difference wasn\u2019t using AI. It was leveraging it \u2014 turning potential into power. Leverage is defined as \u2018power used to achieve a desired result\u2019. That\u2019s what Augmentible is all about.</p>

  </p>
  <p><i>Figure 2 \u2013 The dictionary definition of leverage.</i></p>
  

  <p>You may be thinking \u2014 how is this relevant to me using AI? Well, it\u2019ll make sense. OpenAI has had an investment (to date) of approximately 103 billion USD. Do you know how much developing a cancer drug costs? Or an antibiotic? Compare \u2014 the figures are shocking.</p>
  

  <p>

  </p>
  <p><i>Figure 3 \u2013 A table generated by ChatGPT showing costs for different technologies including ChatGPT investment, antibiotics, and the COVID vaccine.</i></p>
  

  <p>This shows that for the average person to have access to this kind of technology is actually quite anomalous. Even access to the COVID vaccine was a drawn-out deal in 2020. The access we have to AI tools is extraordinary, but most of us are still only scratching the surface.</p>
  

  <p><strong>Why Augmentible Exists?</strong></p>
  

  <p>As Rahul and I dug deeper, we noticed something surprising \u2014 every other industry uses AI for productivity, but Healthcare is lagging, not because of lack of interest, but:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lack of time \u2014 our workday rarely ends at 5</li>
    <li>Endless admin, portfolios, and clinical letters eat into personal time</li>
    <li>Studying for postgraduate exams during free hours</li>
    <li>Unfamiliarity with where AI helps and where it doesn\u2019t</li>
  </ul>
  

  <p>Augmentible exists to change that \u2014 to help doctors LEVERAGE AI, not just \u201Cuse\u201D it. Imagine saving time using tools with investments that big businesses use to automate workflows?</p>
  

  <p>At Augmentible Labs, we\u2019re exploring:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AI-assisted calendar and email-connected planning</li>
    <li>Lightweight admin automations \u2014 audits, templates, budget trackers, portfolio support</li>
    <li>A clinician learning tool to interpret AI outputs safely and practically in clinical roles</li>
  </ul>

<p><strong>What Doctors Need to Know About Using AI for Portfolio Success</strong></p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is now woven into almost every part of a doctor\u2019s working life \u2014 literature search, teaching preparation, reflection writing, or organising portfolio evidence. Most of us already use it more than we admit. But here\u2019s the real question: <b>Are you using AI in a way that meets good professional practice\u2026 or just hoping you are?</b> Because AI is evolving far faster than the guidance written for us, and that gap matters.</p>

<p>AI has been around for some time, and trainees have always looked for ways to reduce friction in tasks like portfolio completion. So it was inevitable that a UK Royal College would eventually publish guidance on how AI should be used.</p>

<p>The first to do this was the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) in September 2024.</p>

<p><img width="623" height="308" src="assets/images/blogs/blog2image.jpeg" alt="RCGP AI guidance figure"></p>
<p><i>Figure 1 \u2014 Part of the RCGP statement on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in postgraduate training and portfolios</i></p>

<p>The message is clear: <b>AI can support you, but you remain the author, the decision-maker, and the accountable professional behind every submission.</b> This isn\u2019t a restriction \u2014 it\u2019s a reminder that integrity and transparency still matter.</p>

<p>RCGP guidance is important because it aligns with UK medical regulatory principles around AI use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AI can help you learn, write, structure, and organise</li>
  <li>Your portfolio must reflect your own understanding</li>
  <li>AI assistance should always be declared</li>
</ul>

<h2>Does this matter if you're not a GP trainee?</h2>
<p>Yes. Until your own Royal College releases portfolio-specific guidance, RCGP serves as the closest credible benchmark. In medicine, when local guidance doesn\u2019t exist, we use the best external standard available \u2014 and this is no different.</p>

<h2>What other medical bodies are saying</h2>

<h3>General Medical Council (GMC)</h3>
<p>Clinicians remain accountable for any work involving AI. If AI cannot replace clinical responsibility, it cannot replace educational accountability either.</p>

<h3>Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC)</h3>
<p>Their report on AI in healthcare highlights safety, transparency, explainability, bias awareness, and human oversight \u2014 principles that also extend naturally into professional portfolio work.</p>

<h2>Why this matters for trainee portfolios</h2>
<p>Doctors use AI to make training sustainable. Common, responsible use cases already include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Turning fragmented notes into coherent reflections</li>
  <li>Drafting teaching material</li>
  <li>Summarising papers</li>
  <li>Structuring QI projects</li>
  <li>Preparing for ARCP</li>
  <li>Clarifying complex guidelines</li>
</ol>

<p><b>AI helps you work faster without replacing understanding \u2014 as long as authorship stays with you.</b></p>

<h2>Radiology trainee insights</h2>
<p>I personally use AI to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Co-read multiple sources and jump directly to the most relevant sections</li>
  <li>Generate smart mnemonics for ILDs, neuroanatomy, and MRI concepts</li>
  <li>Create teaching slides in minutes instead of hours</li>
  <li>Automate certificates and admin tasks</li>
  <li>Build calendars aligned to exam preparation</li>
  <li>Track case logs and identify weak areas</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're curious, sign up to the newsletter for upcoming automation tools and learning support.</p>

<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You are the author</li>
  <li>You are accountable</li>
  <li>You must declare AI assistance</li>
</ul>

<p>Doctors who use AI responsibly will learn faster, write better, organise clearer, and protect the trust that underpins training.</p>

<p>Another way to put it \u2014 they\u2019ll be <b>Augmented</b>.</p>
