  <p><strong>From ChatGPT to Clinical Efficiency: The Story Behind Augmentible</strong></p>

  <p>My first encounter with ChatGPT was for a very small task; every one of my ST1 radiology colleagues had been talking about asking ChatGPT to help with physics preparation for our FRCR Part 1 physics exam. I began using ChatGPT only to help me understand why my \u2018true\u2019 or \u2018false\u2019 was the wrong answer.</p>

  <p>I was never too good at physics, but I guess I hadn\u2019t helped myself by leaving the tougher parts to 6 weeks before the exam. Surprisingly, when I asked ChatGPT to explain my wrong answers, I was stunned. It explained some things more clearly than Google, YouTube, and even some of my seniors! I passed the exam and didn\u2019t really think about it beyond that.</p>

  <p>

  </p>
  <p><i>Figure 1 \u2013 ChatGPT Conversation Screenshot. A screenshot from a ChatGPT \u2018conversation\u2019 I had in January 2025 where I wondered (briefly) if I should just give up Radiology. I chuckled to myself when I read that last line.</i></p>
  

  <p>Let\u2019s fast forward a few months. I had started preparing for on-calls. I was BUSY. Preparing for on-calls, getting ready for ARCP, juggling a packed social calendar and constantly. feeling. behind.</p>
  

  <p>That\u2019s when one of my seniors mentioned \u2018ChatGPT Projects\u2019. He\u2019d uploaded his textbooks and asked ChatGPT to use only those and Radiopaedia as references. Suddenly, everything changed.</p>
  

  <p>I was now reading 3 textbooks simultaneously, getting focused explanations (with page numbers) without having to open a single one of those textbooks. I saved HOURS. I learnt more in the same time period. I reclaimed so much of my time back.</p>
  <p>Honestly, this moment changed my realisations around how we should be learning, but also how new technologies could make life easier.</p>
  

  <p>Since then, I\u2019ve used AI in all sorts of ways to save myself time:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Summarised my curriculum requirements into a manageable monthly checklist so I\u2019m not scrambling a month before the ARCP deadline</li>
    <li>Built teaching presentations in a mere fraction of the time (I once made slides in 10 minutes when I realised at 12:30 that day I was presenting at 1pm!)</li>
    <li>Finding tradesmen with good reviews who can fix my issue (plumbers, electricians) in minutes instead of hours</li>
  </ul>
  

  <p>Are you noticing a theme? Each improvement was small in and of itself, but they all compounded and saved me a TONNE of time. In these last 12 months, I passed FRCR Part 1, started on-calls, completed a Postgraduate Award in AI in healthcare, and submitted 3 papers. The previous year? I was just trying to stay afloat. So what changed?</p>
  

  <p><strong>The Power of Leverage</strong></p>
  

  <p>The difference wasn\u2019t using AI. It was leveraging it \u2013 turning potential into power. Leverage is defined as \u2018power used to achieve a desired result\u2019. That\u2019s what Augmentible is all about.</p>

  </p>
  <p><i>Figure 2 \u2013 The dictionary definition of leverage.</i></p>
  

  <p>You may be thinking, how is this relevant to me using AI? Well it\u2019ll all make sense in a moment. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT has had an investment (to date) of approximately 103 billion USD. (That\u2019s 11 zeros!). Do you know how much developing a cancer drug costs? Or an antibiotic? Take a moment to compare \u2013 the figures are shocking.</p>
  

  <p>

  </p>
  <p><i>Figure 3 - A table generated by ChatGPT showing different costs for different technologies, including ChatGPT investment in 2025, and the cost of an antibiotic and the Covid Vaccine.</i></p>
  

  <p>All of this shows that for the average person to have access to this kind of technology is actually quite anomalous. Even having access to the Covid vaccine was a big drawn-out deal for those of you who remember reading the news in 2020; pharma companies didn\u2019t just give it away, they made sure they made money with their vaccines too. The access we have to these tools is extraordinary, but most of us are only scratching the surface of what\u2019s possible.</p>
  

  <p><strong>Why Augmentible Exists?</strong></p>
  

  <p>As Rahul and I dug deeper, we noticed something quite surprising; every other industry uses AI for productivity, but healthcare is lagging behind - though not because we lack interest.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It\u2019s the lack of time, because our work day rarely finishes at 5.</li>
    <li>It\u2019s the endless admin, portfolio or clinic letters, which eat into our free time.</li>
    <li>It\u2019s the studying in our free time for postgraduate exams.</li>
    <li>To some extent it\u2019s the unfamiliarity we have of what AI is really useful for, where it can help and where it\u2019s pretty useless.</li>
  </ul>
  

  <p>Augmentible exists to change that; to help doctors leverage AI, not just \u201Cuse\u201D it. Imagine saving time using the same tools which have had substantial investments that big businesses are using to employ redundancies?</p>
  

  <p>Right now, at Augmentible Labs, we\u2019re exploring a few ideas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AI assisted calendar and schedule planning which communicates with your email inbox.</li>
    <li>Light weight automations for admin that you\u2019d rather not let take up all your time - audit work, email templates, budget trackers, even portfolio assistance.</li>
    <li>A learning tool for clinicians to understand how AI fits into their clinical roles and how to understand AI outputs in the workplace setting.</li>
  </ul>
  

  <p><strong>Our Promise?</strong></p>
  

  <p>Well, we\u2019re doctors, first and foremost, not programmers. That means all we do should be simple, transparent and genuinely useful - not hype. Expect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Short videos and step-by-step guides.</li>
    <li>Templates for what you can do to optimise your workflows.</li>
    <li>Honest views on what is worth your time and what isn\u2019t.</li>
  </ul>

<p><strong>What Doctors Need to Know About Using AI for Portfolio Success</strong></p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is now woven into almost every part of a doctor\u2019s working life \u2014 literature search, teaching preparation, reflection writing, or organising portfolio evidence. Most of us already use it more than we admit. But here\u2019s the real question: <b>Are you using AI in a way that meets good professional practice\u2026 or just hoping you are?</b> Because AI is evolving far faster than the guidance written for us, and that gap matters.</p>

<p>AI has been around for some time, and trainees have always looked for ways to reduce friction in tasks like portfolio completion. So it was inevitable that a UK Royal College would eventually publish guidance on how AI should be used.</p>

<p>The first to do this was the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) in September 2024.</p>

<p><img width="623" height="308" src="assets/images/blogs/blog2image.jpeg" alt="RCGP AI guidance figure"></p>
<p><i>Figure 1 \u2014 Part of the RCGP statement on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in postgraduate training, examinations and registration</i></p>

<p>The theme is clear; <b>AI can support you, but you remain the author, the decision-maker, and the accountable professional behind every submission.</b> This isn\u2019t restrictive. It\u2019s a reminder that transparency and professional integrity still matter, regardless of which tools we use.</p>
<p>What makes the RCGP\u2019s statement important is that it lands into a UK regulatory environment that is rapidly converging on the same core principles: accountability, explainability, human oversight, and transparency.</p>
<p>Below is what this means for you - whatever your specialty.</p>

<h2>Does the RCGP statement matter if you\u2019re not a GP trainee?</h2>
<p>Yes - and here\u2019s why.</p>
<p>At the moment, the RCGP is the only UK Royal College with portfolio-specific guidance on AI. Until your own College publishes its position, this is the closest thing to a credible, specialty-agnostic benchmark.</p>
<p>The logic mirrors clinical practice - when a local guideline doesn\u2019t exist, we look to the next best external guidance to justify decisions. The same applies here. The RCGP\u2019s stance provides a defensible framework you can cite when explaining how you use AI in educational work.</p>
<p>Their principles are pragmatic:</p>
<ul>
  <li>AI can help you learn, write, structure and organise</li>
  <li>Your portfolio must still reflect your own understanding</li>
  <li>Any AI assistance should be openly declared</li>
</ul>

<h2>Beyond the RCGP: What other bodies are saying</h2>
<p>While no other Royal College has addressed AI in portfolios directly, several national bodies already share overlapping principles.</p>

<h3>General Medical Council (GMC)</h3>
<p>The GMC emphasises that clinicians remain accountable for decisions involving AI. Good Medical Practice also requires reporting adverse incidents involving technology, reinforcing the theme of avoiding over-reliance.</p>
<p>If AI can\u2019t replace clinical responsibility, it certainly can\u2019t replace educational accountability.</p>

<h3>Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC)</h3>
<p>Their Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare report sets expectations around transparency, safety, explainability, and human oversight.</p>
<p>Even though the report addresses clinical practice, the principles naturally extend to portfolio work; reflections, learning logs, teaching evidence - all still represent professional outputs.</p>

<h2>Have other Royal Colleges commented?</h2>
<p>Most have published broad statements on AI in clinical care:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Royal College of Radiologists</li>
  <li>Royal College of Physicians</li>
  <li>Royal College of Anaesthetists</li>
  <li>Royal College of Psychiatrists</li>
  <li>Royal College of Nursing (which even published a practical \u201Cdos and don\u2019ts\u201D guide - a really good introduction article if you\u2019re not sure where to use AI and where not!)</li>
</ol>
<p>All emphasise the same themes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Accountability stays with the clinician</li>
  <li>AI augments - it doesn\u2019t replace</li>
  <li>Bias, safety, and oversight must be considered</li>
  <li>Transparency is essential</li>
</ol>
<p>These principles align perfectly with the RCGP\u2019s statement for trainees.</p>

<h2>Why this matters for trainee portfolios</h2>
<p>Time pressure on trainees is rising across every specialty - clinical duties, exams, QI projects, teaching commitments, and e-portfolio deadlines.</p>
<p>A recent survey in BMJ Open Journal (Warrington et al., 2024) suggests AI has already become an informal practical tool for trainees. It\u2019s no surprise we\u2019re using it to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Turn chaotic notes into coherent reflections</li>
  <li>Draft teaching materials</li>
  <li>Summarise papers</li>
  <li>Structure QI plans</li>
  <li>Prepare for ARCP and</li>
  <li>Clarify tricky guidelines</li>
</ul>

<p>I\u2019m sure none of us are trying to eliminate human learning - we\u2019re trying to make the work doable within the reality of modern training.</p>
<p>AI helps you work faster without shortcutting understanding, as long as the authorship still sits with you.</p>

<h2>Practical Advice for Trainees</h2>
<h3>For all specialties</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The first one is the most important; declare AI use every time, even for small things (e.g. grammar checks, wording refinements).</li>
  <li>For reflections, ask AI to challenge your understanding with ethical or legal angles you may have missed - then you can ask it to summarise your conversation to form your reflective thoughts.</li>
  <li>When reading literature, generate AI summaries with a carefully considered prompt which will find all relevant articles to form a literature log and summary - but remember to validate key points in primary sources yourself.</li>
  <li>Let AI structure your longer pieces: abstracts, QI write-ups, teaching pieces. Then refine with your own expertise, saving hours in the process.</li>
</ul>

<h3>For Radiology Trainees (my world)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I use AI to \u201Cco-read\u201D multiple sources simultaneously (textbooks, Radiopaedia) and then go straight to the most relevant/appropriate cited primary text for a full read.</li>
  <li>AI-generated mnemonics/memory tools massively reduce my cognitive load - especially for ILDs, cardiac MRI, and neuroanatomy (things I\u2019ve found toughest so far).</li>
  <li>Drafting teaching slides takes minutes instead of hours (even if you spend all that saved time watching Netflix\u2026).</li>
  <li>Automating certificates for teaching attendees or other admin tasks saves ENTIRE evenings.</li>
  <li>Integrated calendar generation keeps my FRCR exam preparation timetable fully aligned with iCloud.</li>
  <li>Logging case numbers through an AI assistant gives instant feedback on which systems need practice and how I\u2019m meeting my self-set goals (per week and per month).</li>
</ul>

<p>And if that isn\u2019t enough time saved, you\u2019ll be pleased to hear I\u2019m actively exploring how to automate most of this <b>end-to-end</b>. (If you\u2019re curious, sign up to the newsletter.)
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>AI is now embedded in how doctors study, reflect, organise evidence, and prepare for ARCP.</p>
<p>The RCGP\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t restrict this - it sets a foundation for responsible, transparent integration.</p>
<p>The non-negotiables are simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are the author</li>
  <li>You remain accountable</li>
  <li>You openly declare AI assistance</li>
</ul>

<p>Doctors who use AI well will learn faster, think more clearly, produce higher-quality portfolio evidence, and maintain the professional trust that underpins our training.</p>

<p>Another way to put it \u2014 they\u2019ll be <b>Augmented</b>.</p>
